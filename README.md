# Thogakade - Frontend 

**Thogakade** is a robust Point of Sale (POS) web application designed to streamline operations for small grocery stores. This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to create a backend API for an existing front-end using Jakarta EE. The application handles essential operations like managing customer data, item inventories, and order transactions, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

## Project Overview

Thogakade offers a comprehensive backend solution, implementing a layered architecture to separate concerns and ensure maintainability. The backend is built with Jakarta EE, MySQL for database management, and AJAX for smooth, asynchronous interactions between the client and server.

### Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A well-designed front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Customer Management**: Efficiently manage customer information, including adding, updating, and viewing customer data.
- **Inventory Management**: Handle item inventories, including the addition, deletion, and update of product information.
- **Order Processing**: Manage customer orders with detailed views and processing options.
- **Layered Architecture**: Adheres to a layered architecture, separating business logic, data access, and presentation layers.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation is provided, detailing the available endpoints for interacting with the system.

## Project Structure

### Front-end
The front-end of Thogakade is crafted to deliver a seamless user experience. It includes:

- **Home View**: A welcoming interface to introduce users to the application.
- **Customer Management**: Tools for viewing, adding, updating, and managing customer details.
- **Item Management**: An interface for managing the inventory, including product details, prices, and stock quantities.

### Back-end
The back-end, developed using Jakarta EE, manages server-side operations, data processing, and business logic. It is hosted on the Apache Tomcat server, ensuring reliable performance. Key components include:

- **API Endpoints**: Secure and efficient endpoints for customer, item, and order management.
- **Database Interactions**: Managed through JNDI for efficient connection pooling and database access.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging mechanisms at appropriate levels to monitor and troubleshoot the application.

### Database
- **MySQL**: The application uses MySQL for managing persistent data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **JNDI Configuration**: Used for efficient database connection pooling and management.
